### Key Components

#### 1. **Intent Analysis**
```typescript
interface QueryIntent {
  type: 'calendar' | 'task' | 'note' | 'habit' | 'productivity' | 'search' | 'create' | 'general';
  action: 'query' | 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  entities: {
    timeRef?: string;
    person?: string;
    location?: string;
    topic?: string;
    task?: string;
    event?: string;
  };
  confidence: number;
}
```

#### 2. **Context Loading**
- Loads user data from database (tasks, notes, habits, calendar events)
- Handles errors gracefully with fallback to empty arrays
- Uses Promise.allSettled for parallel loading
- Caches context for performance

#### 3. **Query Handlers**
Each handler specializes in a specific data type:
- **Calendar Handler**: Timezone-aware event processing
- **Task Handler**: Creation and status tracking
- **Note Handler**: Content search and creation
- **Habit Handler**: Performance analysis and trends
- **Productivity Handler**: Cross-data insights
- **Search Handler**: Multi-platform search
