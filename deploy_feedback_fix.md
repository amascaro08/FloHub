# Feedback System Database Fix - Deployment Guide

## Issue Summary
The feedback page was creating GitHub issues correctly but failing to save to the Neon database due to the code using incorrect column names that didn't match the actual database schema.

## Root Cause
The code was expecting different column names than what actually exists in the database:
- **Code Expected**: Column names based on outdated schema assumptions
- **Actual Database Schema**: `user_email`, `title`, `description` (all exist and are correct)

## Actual Database Schema (Provided)
```
id                    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
user_id               UUID
title                 TEXT
description           TEXT  
status                TEXT DEFAULT 'open'
github_issue_number   INTEGER
github_issue_url      TEXT
completed_at          TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
notification_sent     BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
created_at            TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
updated_at            TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
user_email            VARCHAR(255)
```

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Column Usage**: Updated both APIs to use the correct existing columns
2. **Updated Schema Definition**: Fixed `db/schema.ts` to match actual database
3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed unnecessary schema detection code

## Files Modified
- `pages/api/github-issues.ts` - Fixed to use correct `user_email`, `title`, `description` columns
- `pages/api/feedback.ts` - Updated insertion and retrieval to use correct schema
- `db/schema.ts` - Updated schema definition to match actual database

## Key Changes Made

### github-issues.ts
```sql
-- Before (incorrect)
INSERT INTO feedback (some_wrong_columns...)

-- After (correct)
INSERT INTO feedback (user_email, title, description, status)
VALUES (${user.email}, ${title}, ${feedbackText}, 'open')
```

### feedback.ts
- Removed complex schema detection logic
- Uses correct `user_email` column for queries
- Maps `description` to `feedbackText` for API compatibility

### db/schema.ts
- Removed `.notNull()` from `title` (matches actual schema)
- Removed `.notNull()` from `status` (has default value)
- Updated field types to match database

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Code Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix feedback database schema to match actual Neon database"
git push
```

### Step 2: Test Feedback Submission
1. Go to `/feedback` page
2. Submit test feedback
3. Verify GitHub issue is created AND database entry is saved
4. Check logs for successful completion

## No Database Migration Needed
Since the database schema was already correct, no migration is required. The issue was purely in the application code using wrong column names.

## Expected Outcome
After deployment:
- ✅ Feedback submits to GitHub (already working)
- ✅ Feedback saves to Neon database (now fixed)
- ✅ No database changes required
- ✅ Immediate resolution

## Verification
You should see successful logs showing:
1. "Basic insertion successful"
2. "GitHub info update successful"
3. No more database constraint errors

The error `"Failed to save feedback to database"` should be completely resolved.
