# FloCat Contextual Calendar Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced FloCat's calendar intelligence to handle contextual queries about specific events, making it much smarter than just showing generic schedules.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: When asked "when do I take mum to the airport", FloCat would just show the next scheduled events instead of finding the specific event.

**After**: FloCat now searches through calendar events using intelligent keyword matching and provides specific, contextual answers.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Contextual Query Detection
- Added detection for "when do I" and "when am I" patterns
- Enhanced trigger phrases to include contextual keywords like "airport", "mum", "flight", etc.

### 2. Intelligent Keyword Extraction
- Removes stop words and extracts meaningful keywords from queries
- Expands keywords with common synonyms (e.g., "mum" ‚Üí "mum", "mom", "mother")
- Handles context-specific terms (e.g., "airport" ‚Üí "flight", "plane", "travel")

### 3. Smart Event Matching
- Searches event titles, descriptions, and locations for keyword matches
- Prioritizes upcoming events over past events
- Provides intelligent fallbacks for past events

### 4. Natural Language Responses
- Provides specific event details with natural time references
- Shows countdown information ("That's in 3 days", "That's tomorrow!")
- Includes location and description details when available

## Enhanced Query Examples

### ‚úÖ Now Supported
- "When do I take mum to the airport?"
- "When am I meeting with the doctor?"
- "What time is my flight?"
- "When do I have that appointment with dad?"
- "When is mum's surgery?"

### Response Format
```
üìÖ **Mum flight** is scheduled for **this Wednesday** at **2:30 PM**
üìç Location: Airport Terminal 2
üìù Pick up mum for her flight to Sydney

‚è∞ That's in 2 days.
```
