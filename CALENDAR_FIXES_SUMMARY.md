# Calendar Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. "Invalid provider" Error
**Problem**: The calendar API was receiving requests with `o365Url` parameters but failing to process them correctly.

**Fix**: Updated `pages/api/calendar.ts` to properly handle O365 URLs from query parameters:
- Added fallback logic to check for `o365Url` in query parameters when no calendar sources are found
- Improved error handling for O365 calendar processing

### 2. "Not signed in" Error in AtAGlanceWidget
**Problem**: The `fetchCalendarEvents` function was expecting the response to have an `events` property, but the calendar API returns events directly as an array.

**Fix**: Updated `lib/widgetFetcher.ts`:
```typescript
// Before
return data.events || [];

// After  
return Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data.events || []);
```

### 3. OAuth Redirect Issue
**Problem**: Google OAuth was redirecting to login page instead of settings page after successful authentication.

**Fix**: Updated `pages/api/auth/callback/google-additional.ts`:
- Changed redirect URLs to include proper tab parameter: `/dashboard/settings?tab=calendar&success=google_connected`
- Added fallback redirect to login with return URL when user is not authenticated

### 4. Power Automate URL Not Displaying in Settings
**Problem**: The Power Automate URL was not being displayed in the user settings page.

**Fix**: Updated `components/settings/CalendarSettings.tsx`:
- Added display of Power Automate URL in calendar source list
- Added legacy Power Automate URL display section
- Improved calendar source management with proper O365 source creation
- Added "Convert to Calendar Source" button for legacy URLs

### 5. Login Form Return URL Handling
**Problem**: Login form wasn't handling return URLs from OAuth redirects.

**Fix**: Updated `components/ui/LoginForm.tsx`:
- Added support for `returnUrl` query parameter
- Redirects to the specified URL after successful login instead of always going to dashboard

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Google Calendar Connection**:
   - Go to Settings > Calendar
   - Click "Add Google Calendar"
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Verify redirect to settings page with success message

2. **Test Power Automate URL**:
   - Go to Settings > Calendar
   - Click "Add Power Automate URL"
   - Enter a valid Power Automate URL
   - Verify it appears in the calendar sources list

3. **Test Dashboard Loading**:
   - After adding calendar sources, refresh the dashboard
   - Verify no "Invalid provider" or "Not signed in" errors
   - Check that calendar events are displayed correctly

4. **Test Legacy URL Conversion**:
   - If you have an existing Power Automate URL in settings
   - Click "Convert to Calendar Source"
   - Verify it appears as a proper calendar source

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET`

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes in a development environment
2. Verify that all calendar integrations work correctly
3. Check that the dashboard loads without errors
4. Ensure OAuth flows complete successfully
5. Validate that Power Automate URLs are properly displayed and functional
