# FloCat AI Assistant - Enhanced Intelligence System

## Overview

FloCat's AI Assistant has been completely redesigned to be a **truly intelligent personal assistant** that learns from your patterns, provides proactive suggestions, and acts contextually aware of all your data within the app.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence Features

### 1. Pattern Recognition & Learning
The AI assistant continuously analyzes your behavior patterns across:
- **Task Management**: Completion rates, preferred days, procrastination trends
- **Habit Tracking**: Consistency scores, struggling vs. successful habits, optimal times
- **Workflow Analysis**: Meeting-to-note patterns, tag usage, productivity cycles
- **Time Patterns**: Most active hours, productive days, energy levels
- **Productivity Metrics**: Tasks per day, focus time, goal achievement rates

### 2. Proactive Suggestions System
Based on pattern analysis, the AI generates actionable suggestions:

#### Habit Adjustments
- **Frequency Changes**: "Your daily meditation has 25% consistency. Consider changing to weekly to rebuild momentum."
- **Schedule Optimization**: "You complete workouts 80% more on weekends. Consider weekend-only scheduling."
- **Time Recommendations**: "You're most successful with habits between 7-9 AM."

#### Workflow Optimization
- **Meeting Note Reminders**: "You're only taking notes for 40% of meetings. Set up note-taking reminders?"
- **Task Breakdown**: "Low completion rate detected. Consider breaking large tasks into smaller pieces."
- **Context Switching**: "High task switching detected during 2-4 PM. Block focus time?"

#### Health & Wellness
- **Stress Detection**: "3+ negative moods this week. Consider scheduling self-care time."
- **Break Reminders**: "No breaks logged today. Take a 15-minute walk?"
- **Energy Management**: "You're most productive on Tuesdays. Schedule important tasks then."

### 3. Natural Language Query Processing
Ask questions in natural language:

#### Temporal Queries
- "When did I last work on the marketing project?"
- "What meetings do I have with Sarah this week?"
- "Show me notes from last Monday's standup"

#### Pattern Queries
- "How are my habits doing?"
- "What's my productivity like this month?"
- "Which tasks am I struggling with?"

#### Search & Discovery
- "Find everything related to #client-work"
- "Show me notes about the new feature"
- "What did I accomplish yesterday?"

### 4. Contextual Task Management
Enhanced natural language task creation:

```
"Add task: Review presentation due tomorrow #work urgent"
"Create task: Call dentist for appointment due end of week"
"New task: Buy groceries due this Friday #personal"
```

#### Smart Task Features
- **Natural Language Due Dates**: "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 3 days", "end of month"
- **Automatic Priority Detection**: Recognizes "urgent", "ASAP", "critical", "important"
- **Tag Extraction**: Automatically extracts #hashtags from task descriptions
- **Smart Search**: Find tasks by partial text, tags, or due date ranges
