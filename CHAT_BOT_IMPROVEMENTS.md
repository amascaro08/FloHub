# FloCat Chat Bot - Enhanced Personal Assistant

## Overview

I've significantly enhanced FloCat's chat bot capabilities to transform it into a true personal assistant with advanced contextual awareness, natural language processing, and timezone intelligence. The bot now provides accurate, contextual responses and can perform complex actions like creating tasks and calendar events through natural language.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

#### Intent Recognition System
- **Pattern Analysis**: Advanced regex patterns and entity extraction for better understanding
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI confidence levels to determine response quality
- **Entity Detection**: Automatically identifies:
  - Time references (today, tomorrow, next week, specific days)
  - People (mom, dad, colleague names)
  - Locations (airport, office, home)
  - Event types (meetings, appointments, calls)
  - Urgency levels (urgent, important, ASAP)

#### Example Queries Now Supported:
```
"When do I take mum to the airport?" 
‚Üí Returns specific event with date and time, not just schedule

"Add a task to call dentist tomorrow"
‚Üí Creates task with proper due date in user's timezone

"Schedule meeting with John next Friday at 2 PM"
‚Üí Creates calendar event with natural language parsing
```

### 2. **Timezone Intelligence**

#### User-Aware Time Handling
- **Personal Timezone**: All times displayed in user's configured timezone
- **Smart Date Parsing**: Understands relative dates with timezone context
- **Consistent Formatting**: All calendar events and times properly localized

#### Before vs After:
```
Before: "Your meeting is at 14:00 UTC"
After:  "Your meeting is at 2:00 PM (Pacific Time)"
```

### 3. **Contextual Calendar Intelligence**

#### Smart Calendar Search
- **Keyword Matching**: Advanced search with synonyms and context
- **Relationship Understanding**: Connects "mum" with "mother", "family"
- **Location Intelligence**: Links "airport" with "flight", "travel", "departure"

#### Enhanced Response Personalization:
```
Query: "When do I take mum to the airport?"
Response: "You're taking mum to the airport this Wednesday at 10:30 AM
üìç Location: LAX Terminal 3
‚è∞ That's in 2 days."
```

### 4. **Intelligent Task Management**

#### Natural Language Task Creation
- **Flexible Patterns**: Multiple ways to express task creation
- **Auto-Classification**: Determines work vs personal context
- **Due Date Parsing**: Understands "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 3 days"
- **Priority Detection**: Identifies urgent/important tasks

#### Examples:
```
"Add a task for tomorrow called review presentation"
"Create urgent task: call client ASAP"
"Make a personal task to buy groceries due next Monday"
```

### 5. **Enhanced Calendar Event Creation**

#### Natural Language Event Parsing
- **Smart Title Extraction**: Removes command words, keeps meaningful content
- **Time Detection**: Recognizes various time formats (2 PM, 14:00, 2:30)
- **Date Understanding**: Handles today, tomorrow, specific days, date formats
- **Duration Calculation**: Understands "2 hours", "30 minutes", "1h"
- **Location Extraction**: Identifies venues from natural language

#### Example Event Creation:
```
Input: "Schedule dentist appointment tomorrow at 3 PM for 1 hour at downtown clinic"
Creates: 
- Title: "Dentist appointment"
- Date: Tomorrow
- Time: 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM (user timezone)
- Location: "Downtown clinic"
```

### 6. **Proactive Intelligence**

#### Smart Suggestions
- **Pattern Analysis**: Learns from user behavior
- **Habit Optimization**: Suggests improvements to routines
- **Workload Management**: Identifies overdue tasks and busy periods
- **Wellness Reminders**: Monitors mood patterns for breaks

#### Contextual Recommendations:
```
"üí° You have 3 urgent tasks and no meetings today - perfect time to focus!"
"‚è∞ Your next meeting with mom starts in 15 minutes!"
"üéØ Consider changing your 'Exercise' habit to weekends - you complete it 80% more on weekends."
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture Changes

#### 1. **Enhanced Assistant API** (`pages/api/assistant.ts`)
- **Intent Analysis**: `analyzeUserIntent()` function for NLP
- **Contextual Processing**: `processCalendarQuery()` for intelligent calendar handling
- **Timezone Management**: Consistent timezone handling throughout
- **Action Integration**: Direct task/event creation from natural language

#### 2. **Improved Calendar Capability** (`lib/capabilities/calendarCapability.ts`)
- **Intent-Based Routing**: Smart query classification
- **Enhanced Search**: Multi-keyword matching with synonyms
- **Personalized Responses**: Context-aware response formatting
- **Time Intelligence**: Timezone-aware date/time handling

#### 3. **Smart AI Assistant** (`lib/aiAssistant.ts`)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced user behavior analysis
- **Contextual Search**: Enhanced calendar query processing
- **Predictive Insights**: Proactive suggestion generation
- **Learning System**: Adapts to user preferences and patterns

#### 4. **New Calendar Management API** (`pages/api/assistant/calendar.ts`)

- **Smart Event Creation**: Intelligent field extraction
- **Search Capabilities**: Advanced event search and filtering
- **Integration Layer**: Seamless connection with existing calendar APIs

### Key Features Added

#### Enhanced Intent Recognition
```typescript
interface UserIntent {
  type: 'question' | 'command' | 'request' | 'search';
  category: 'calendar' | 'tasks' | 'habits' | 'notes' | 'general';
  action?: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'search';
  entities: {
    timeRef?: string;
    person?: string;
    location?: string;
    urgency?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  };
  confidence: number;
}
```

#### Timezone-Aware Date Processing
```typescript
function getTimezoneAwareDates(userTimezone: string) {
  const now = new Date();
  const nowInUserTz = toZonedTime(now, userTimezone);
  const today = new Date(nowInUserTz.getFullYear(), nowInUserTz.getMonth(), nowInUserTz.getDate());
  // ... proper timezone handling
}
```

#### Advanced Calendar Search
```typescript
function extractCalendarKeywords(query: string): string[] {
  // Synonym expansion: "mum" ‚Üí ["mum", "mom", "mother", "family"]
  // Context expansion: "airport" ‚Üí ["flight", "plane", "travel", "departure"]
  // Smart filtering removes stop words and enhances relevance
}
```
