# Google OAuth Debugging & Fixes Applied

## 🚨 **Current Issue Analysis**

You're experiencing:
1. ✅ OAuth redirect now works (no more 404)
2. ❌ But callback fails with `oauth_failed` error
3. ❌ Settings page incorrectly shows "Google Calendar connected"
4. ✅ Office 365 Power Automate URLs work perfectly

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Added Comprehensive Logging**
I've added extensive logging throughout the OAuth flow to identify exactly where it's failing:

#### **Files Modified with Debugging:**
- `pages/api/auth/callback/google-additional.ts` - Full callback flow logging
- `lib/googleMultiAuth.ts` - Token exchange logging

#### **Logging Indicators:**
- 🔥 Process start
- ✅ Success steps
- ❌ Error conditions  
- ⚠️ Warnings
- 🔄 Processing steps
- 🔍 Data lookups
- 🎉 Completion

### **2. Fixed Connection Status Detection**
- **Problem:** `/api/calendar/list` returned HTTP 200 with empty array when Google wasn't connected
- **Fix:** Now returns HTTP 401 error when no Google account exists
- **Result:** Settings page will correctly show "Not Connected" status

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added detailed error logging at each step
- Improved user feedback with specific error messages
- Better state management for user identification

## 🔍 **What the Logs Will Show**

After deployment, when you attempt Google OAuth, check the Vercel function logs for this sequence:

### **Expected Success Flow:**
```
🔥 Google OAuth callback started
✅ Authorization code received  
✅ State decoded, user email: your@email.com
🔄 getGoogleTokens called with code: 4/0Adeu5B...
OAuth Config: { clientId: "123456789...", clientSecret: "Set", redirectUri: "https://..." }
🔄 Exchanging code for tokens...
✅ Tokens received from Google: { hasAccessToken: true, hasRefreshToken: true, expiresIn: 3599 }
🔍 Looking up user by email: your@email.com
✅ User found: 123
🔍 Checking for existing Google account...
🔄 Creating new Google account... (or Updating existing...)
✅ Created new Google account
🔄 Updating user settings with Google Calendar source...
✅ Successfully added Google Calendar source
🎉 Google OAuth flow completed successfully
```

### **Common Failure Points to Watch For:**

#### **❌ Token Exchange Failed:**
```
❌ Error getting tokens from Google: [Error details]
```
**Cause:** Invalid client credentials or redirect URI mismatch

#### **❌ User Not Found:**
```
❌ User not found by email: your@email.com
```
**Cause:** Email in state doesn't match database

#### **❌ Database Insert Failed:**
```
❌ Database error during account creation
```
**Cause:** Database connection or schema issues

#### **❌ Settings Update Failed:**
```
❌ Failed to update user settings: 500
```
**Cause:** UserSettings API error

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Deploy & Test OAuth Flow**
1. Deploy the latest code with logging
2. Go to Settings → Calendar  
3. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
4. Complete OAuth flow
5. Check Vercel function logs for the detailed flow

### **2. Check Connection Status**
- Settings page should now show correct connection status
- Debug page (`/calendar/debug`) should match settings page
- Calendar events should appear if connection succeeds

### **3. Check Logs in Vercel**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check logs for `/api/auth/callback/google-additional`
4. Look for the emoji indicators to trace the flow

## 🎯 **Most Likely Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Google Cloud Console Configuration**
**Symptoms:** Token exchange fails immediately
**Check:** Logs show "Error getting tokens from Google"
**Solution:** Verify redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches:
```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google-additional
```

### **Issue 2: Environment Variables**
**Symptoms:** "OAuth configuration missing required parameters"
**Check:** Logs show config values as "Not set"
**Solution:** Verify in Vercel:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`

### **Issue 3: Database/User Issues**
**Symptoms:** "User not found by email"
**Check:** Email in logs doesn't match your account
**Solution:** Ensure you're logged in with the same email used in OAuth state

### **Issue 4: UserSettings API Issues**
**Symptoms:** Settings update fails but account is created
**Check:** "Failed to update user settings" in logs
**Result:** Google account will be connected but calendar source won't appear
**Solution:** Check `/api/userSettings` endpoint

## 📋 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **If Successful:**
- ✅ No more `oauth_failed` redirects
- ✅ Settings page shows "Google Calendar Connected"  
- ✅ Calendar debug page shows "Connected" status
- ✅ Google Calendar events appear in main calendar
- ✅ Calendar sources list shows "Google Calendar"

### **If Still Failing:**
- 📋 Detailed logs will pinpoint exact failure point
- 🔍 Error messages will be specific and actionable
- 🛠 Can fix the specific issue identified in logs

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the debugging version**
2. **Test OAuth flow and capture logs**
3. **Share the specific error logs if it still fails**
4. **I can then provide targeted fixes based on exact failure point**

The extensive logging will make it much easier to identify and fix the remaining issue! 🎯
