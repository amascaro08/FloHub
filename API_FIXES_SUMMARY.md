# API Route Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

From the console errors, multiple API endpoints were returning 500 Internal Server Errors:
- `/api/userSettings` 
- `/api/userSettings/layouts`
- `/api/tasks`
- `/api/calendar` (400 Bad Request with "Invalid provider" error)

## Root Cause

The primary issue was **shared library dependencies** in Vercel's serverless environment. Multiple API routes were importing `getUserById` from `@/lib/user`, which created circular dependencies and caused database client import issues in the serverless functions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Eliminated Shared getUserById Imports

Moved the `getUserById` function definition directly into each API route that needs it, removing the shared import dependency. Fixed in:

- `pages/api/calendar.ts`
- `pages/api/assistant.ts` 
- `pages/api/debug.ts`
- `pages/api/feedback.ts`
- `pages/api/searchByTag.ts`
- `pages/api/userSettingsDebug.ts`
- `pages/api/calendar/index.ts`

### 2. Standardized Import Paths

Unified all import paths to use the `@/` alias instead of relative paths for consistency:

- Changed `"../../lib/auth"` to `"@/lib/auth"` in `userSettings.ts`
- Changed `"../../lib/drizzle"` to `"@/lib/drizzle"` in `userSettings.ts`
- Changed `"../../db/schema"` to `"@/db/schema"` in `userSettings.ts`
- Changed `"../../types/app"` to `"@/types/app"` in `userSettings.ts` and `calendar.ts`

### 3. Fixed Duplicate Imports

Resolved TypeScript compilation errors caused by duplicate imports:

- Removed duplicate `db` import in `assistant.ts`
- Removed duplicate `eq` import in `feedback.ts`
- Removed duplicate `eq` import in `searchByTag.ts`

## Benefits

- **Serverless Isolation**: Each API route is now self-contained with its own `getUserById` function
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Eliminated circular dependencies between API routes and shared libraries
- **Better Error Handling**: Cleaner separation allows for better error tracking per endpoint
- **Consistent Architecture**: All API routes now follow the same pattern

## Build Status

✅ Build completed successfully (exit code 0)
✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
✅ No database client import issues on client-side
✅ Proper client/server separation maintained

## Expected Resolution

These fixes should resolve the 500 Internal Server Errors for:
- User settings loading
- Layout management
- Task management
- Calendar functionality

The application should now load the dashboard completely without server errors.
