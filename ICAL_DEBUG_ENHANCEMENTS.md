# iCal Debug Enhancements Summary

This document summarizes the recent enhancements made to improve iCal integration debugging and timeout handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased iCal Timeout to 30 Seconds

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/api/calendar.ts` - Main calendar API
- `pages/api/calendar/test-ical.ts` - iCal URL testing endpoint

**Changes:**
- Updated timeout from 8 seconds to 30 seconds for better reliability with slower iCal feeds
- Changed from `timeout: 8000` to `timeout: 30000` in both files

**Rationale:**
- Some iCal feeds can be slow to respond, especially public calendar feeds
- 30 seconds provides a better balance between user experience and reliability
- Prevents premature timeouts on valid but slow feeds

### 2. Enhanced Calendar Debug Page

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/api/calendar/debug.ts` - Debug API backend
- `pages/calendar/debug.tsx` - Debug page frontend

**New Debug Features:**

#### Calendar Sources Debug Section
- **Google Calendar Debug:**
  - Event count from primary calendar
  - Connection status (success, token_expired, api_error, etc.)
  - Error details if any issues occur

- **O365/PowerAutomate Debug:**
  - Individual source debugging for each configured URL
  - Event count per source
  - Connection status per URL
  - Truncated URL display for security
  - Detailed error messages

- **iCal Feeds Debug:**
  - Individual feed debugging for each configured iCal URL
  - Event count per feed
  - Connection status per URL
  - Calendar metadata extraction (name, description, timezone)
  - WebCal URL conversion handling
  - Comprehensive error reporting

#### Enhanced Summary Section
- Added "Total Events Found" counter showing combined events from all sources
- Real-time event count aggregation across Google, O365, and iCal sources

### 3. Debug API Backend Enhancements

**New Function: `debugCalendarSources()`**
- Parallel processing of all calendar source types
- Individual testing of each configured source
- Proper error handling and categorization
- Metadata extraction for iCal feeds

**Debug Data Structure:**
```typescript
calendarSourcesDebug: {
  google: {
    eventCount: number;
    status: string;
    error?: string;
  };
  o365: {
    eventCount: number;
    sources: Array<{
      name: string;
      url: string;
      eventCount: number;
      status: string;
      error?: string;
    }>;
  };
  ical: {
    eventCount: number;
    sources: Array<{
      name: string;
      url: string;
      eventCount: number;
      status: string;
      error?: string;
      calendarInfo?: any;
    }>;
  };
}
```

### 4. User Experience Improvements

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Color-coded status indicators (green for success, red for errors)
- Icons for each calendar type (üìÖ Google, üè¢ O365, üîó iCal)
- Event counts displayed next to each source type
- Expandable error details
- Calendar metadata display for iCal feeds

**Information Display:**
- Truncated URLs for security (showing first 40 characters)
- Break-all text handling for long URLs
- Proper spacing and organization
- Clear status messages

## Debug Page Features

### What Gets Tested
1. **Google Calendar:**
   - Token validity and expiration
   - API connectivity
   - Event retrieval from primary calendar

2. **O365/PowerAutomate:**
   - URL accessibility
   - JSON response parsing
   - Event count extraction

3. **iCal Feeds:**
   - URL accessibility (including webcal:// conversion)
   - iCal parsing with node-ical
   - Event count and calendar metadata extraction
   - Comprehensive error categorization

### Error Categories
- `success` - Everything working correctly
- `not_connected` - Source not configured
- `token_expired` - Google token needs refresh
- `api_error` - HTTP error from remote service
- `fetch_error` - Network or parsing error
- `no_url` - Missing connection data

### Performance Considerations
- All source testing runs in parallel
- 10-second timeout for debug operations (shorter than main API)
- Non-blocking error handling
- Cached token validation

## Usage

To access the enhanced debug page:
1. Go to `/calendar/debug`
2. Click "Refresh" to run new diagnostics
3. Review the "Calendar Sources Debug" section for detailed per-source information
4. Check event counts to verify feeds are working
5. Use error messages to troubleshoot configuration issues

## Benefits

1. **Faster Troubleshooting:** Instantly see which calendar sources are working
2. **Event Count Visibility:** Know exactly how many events each source provides
3. **Detailed Error Messages:** Specific error information for each source
4. **Real-time Testing:** Test changes immediately without waiting for calendar refresh
5. **Better Reliability:** 30-second timeout reduces false negatives from slow feeds

This enhancement significantly improves the debugging experience for calendar integration issues and provides valuable insights into the health and performance of each calendar source.
