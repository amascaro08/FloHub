# Calendar Context Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **useCalendarContext Error in Production**
**Error**: `useCalendarContext must be used within a CalendarProvider`

**Root Cause**: The `MobileDashboard` component was using `CalendarWidget` and `AtAGlanceWidget` components that require the `CalendarProvider` context, but the `MobileDashboard` was not wrapped with the `CalendarProvider`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `CalendarProvider` import to `MobileDashboard.tsx`
- Wrapped the entire `MobileDashboard` component with `CalendarProvider`
- Added proper date range calculation for the calendar context
- Ensured the provider is enabled only when user is authenticated

**Files Modified**:
- `components/dashboard/MobileDashboard.tsx`

### 2. **TypeScript Error in MobileDashboard**
**Error**: `Variable 'quicknoteTimer' is used before being assigned`

**Root Cause**: The `quicknoteTimer` variable was declared but not properly initialized before being used in the cleanup function.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `let quicknoteTimer: NodeJS.Timeout;` 
- To `let quicknoteTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | undefined;`

**Files Modified**:
- `components/dashboard/MobileDashboard.tsx`
