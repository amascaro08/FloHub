# Calendar Widget Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Calendar API 400 Error
**Problem**: Calendar widget was receiving 400 errors with message "Missing timeMin or timeMax"

**Root Cause**: AtAGlanceWidget was calling the calendar API without required `timeMin` and `timeMax` parameters.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `AtAGlanceWidget.tsx` to calculate proper time ranges
- Added `timeMin` and `timeMax` parameters to the calendar API call
- Time range now covers today + next 7 days for better event coverage

### 2. Calendar Widget Not Showing Events
**Problem**: Calendar widget wasn't displaying events despite the main calendar page working

**Root Cause**: API URL construction was not properly validated before making requests

**Fix**:
- Added `useMemo` for API URL construction with proper validation
- Added null checks for timeRange before building the API URL
- Improved error logging and debugging

### 3. At A Glance Widget Not Showing Tomorrow's Events
**Problem**: Tomorrow's events were not appearing in the At A Glance widget

**Root Cause**: Date filtering logic for tomorrow's events was imprecise

**Fix**:
- Improved tomorrow event filtering in `generateDashboardWidget` function
- Added proper end-of-day calculation for tomorrow's date range

### 4. Calendar Widget Enhancements
**Improvements Added**:
- **Upcoming Event Highlighting**: Next upcoming event is now highlighted with teal border and üìç icon
- **Teams Button Integration**: Microsoft Teams meeting links are properly extracted and displayed
- **Better Error Handling**: More user-friendly error messages and loading states
- **View Toggles**: Today/Tomorrow/Week view toggles work correctly

### 5. Work Event HTML Content Formatting Fix
**Problem**: Work events with HTML content in descriptions were showing raw HTML instead of formatted content

**Root Cause**: CalendarWidget was displaying event descriptions as plain text without HTML detection/parsing

**Fix**:
- Added `containsHTML()` helper function to detect HTML content in event descriptions
- Enhanced HTML detection to include common tags: `<p>`, `<br>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<table>`, and HTML entities
- Added Tailwind Typography plugin (`@tailwindcss/typography`) for proper prose styling
- Updated CalendarWidget event details modal to render HTML content using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with prose styling
- Applied same fix to main calendar page for consistency
- HTML content now renders with proper formatting while plain text uses `whitespace-pre-wrap` for line breaks

**Technical Details**:
- Installed `@tailwindcss/typography` package
- Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include typography plugin
- Added comprehensive HTML detection for tags and entities
- Used `prose prose-sm max-w-none dark:prose-invert` classes for styled HTML rendering

## Key Fixes Applied
1. **AtAGlanceWidget API Call**: Now includes proper timeMin/timeMax parameters
2. **CalendarWidget URL Construction**: Uses useMemo with validation
3. **Tomorrow Event Filtering**: Improved date boundary calculations
4. **Visual Enhancements**: Highlighted upcoming events and Teams integration
5. **HTML Content Rendering**: Proper formatting for work events with HTML descriptions

## Files Modified
- `components/widgets/CalendarWidget.tsx`
- `components/widgets/AtAGlanceWidget.tsx`
- `pages/calendar/index.tsx`
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `package.json` (added @tailwindcss/typography)

Both widgets now share a consistent approach to calendar API integration, HTML content rendering, and provide a better user experience.
