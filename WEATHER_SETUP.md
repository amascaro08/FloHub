# Weather Widget Setup

The weather widget has been completely redesigned to work without any API keys or external authentication.

## New Free Weather Widget

The weather widget now uses:
- **IP-based Geolocation**: Automatically detects your location using your IP address
- **Open-Meteo API**: Free weather service that doesn't require API keys
- **Fallback Location**: Uses a default location if geolocation fails
- **No Permissions Required**: No browser location permissions needed

## Features

- **No API Key Required**: Completely free to use
- **Automatic Location Detection**: Uses IP-based geolocation
- **Real-time Weather**: Shows current temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile with compact and full layouts
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network errors with fallback options
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh option available

## Widget Location

The weather widget is now available as a dashboard widget and can be:
- Added to any dashboard layout
- Selected from the widget options when customizing layouts
- Resized based on the slot size (small, medium, large)
- Positioned anywhere in your dashboard grid

## Available in Layout Templates

The weather widget is included in the following layout templates:
- **Command Center**: In the "Updates" section at the bottom
- **Custom Layouts**: Can be added to any available slot

## Technical Details

- Uses https://ipapi.co for IP geolocation (with fallback)
- Uses https://api.open-meteo.com for weather data
- No rate limits or API key requirements
- Automatically handles CORS and mixed content policies
- Provides fallback location if geolocation fails

## Notes

- Weather data is fetched automatically when the widget loads
- Location is determined by IP address, so it may not be 100% accurate
- If location services fail, it defaults to San Francisco weather
- The widget refreshes data when the refresh button is clicked
- No browser permissions or user interaction required
