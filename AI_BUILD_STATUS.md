## üéØ Smart Assistant Features (Ready to Enable)

### Pattern Analysis
```typescript
- Task completion patterns (rates, preferred days, overdue tracking)
- Habit consistency scoring (struggling vs successful habits)
- Time pattern recognition (most active hours, productive days)
- Workflow analysis (meeting notes, tag usage, productivity cycles)
```

### Proactive Suggestions
```typescript
- Habit frequency adjustments ("daily ‚Üí weekly for low consistency")
- Schedule optimization ("you work better on weekends")
- Workflow improvements ("missing meeting notes detected")
- Wellness reminders ("stress pattern detected")
```

### Natural Language Processing
```typescript

- Content queries: "What meetings do I have with person Z?"
```

The foundation is complete and ready for the smart features to be activated once the basic build is verified.
