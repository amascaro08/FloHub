# FloHub Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the FloHub application. The audit covered authentication, authorization, input validation, data protection, and information disclosure vulnerabilities.

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### ðŸ”´ 1. Debug Endpoints Exposed in Production
**Risk Level:** Critical  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

**Issue:** Multiple debug endpoints (`/api/debug/*`) were accessible in production, exposing sensitive information including:
- Environment variables
- Database connection details
- Authentication tokens
- User information

**Fix Applied:**
- Added production environment checks to all debug endpoints
- Debug endpoints now return 404 in production
- Implemented proper access controls

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/api/debug/env-check.ts`
- `pages/api/debug/auth-test.ts`
- `pages/api/debug/domain-test.ts`
- `pages/api/debug/cookie-test.ts`
- `pages/api/debug/google-calendar-sources.ts`

### ðŸ”´ 2. Excessive Console Logging
**Risk Level:** High  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

**Issue:** Numerous console.log statements throughout the codebase exposed sensitive information in browser console and server logs.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed excessive logging from middleware
- Implemented development-only logging
- Sanitized log messages to prevent information disclosure
- Added proper error handling without exposing internal details

**Files Modified:**
- `middleware.ts`
- `lib/auth.ts`

### ðŸ”´ 3. Missing Rate Limiting
**Risk Level:** High  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

**Issue:** No rate limiting on authentication endpoints, making the application vulnerable to brute force attacks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created comprehensive rate limiting system (`lib/rateLimiter.ts`)
- Applied strict rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- Implemented different rate limit configurations for different endpoint types
- Added proper rate limit headers and error responses

**Rate Limit Configurations:**
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- User-specific endpoints: 200 requests per 15 minutes

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/rateLimiter.ts` (new)
- `pages/api/auth/login.ts`
- `pages/api/auth/register.ts`

### ðŸ”´ 4. Weak CSRF Protection
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

**Issue:** CSRF headers were set but no actual CSRF token validation was implemented.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created comprehensive CSRF protection system (`lib/csrfProtection.ts`)
- Implemented CSRF token generation and validation
- Added CSRF token endpoint (`/api/csrf-token`)
- Created client-side CSRF token management utilities

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/csrfProtection.ts` (new)
- `pages/api/csrf-token.ts` (new)

### ðŸ”´ 5. Insufficient Input Validation
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

**Issue:** Some endpoints lacked proper input sanitization, potentially allowing XSS and injection attacks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced input validation in registration endpoint
- Added email and password validation
- Implemented proper input sanitization
- Added length and format restrictions

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/api/auth/register.ts`
- `lib/validation.ts` (enhanced)

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### ðŸ”µ 1. Comprehensive Security Headers
**Status:** âœ… Implemented

**Enhancements:**
- Added security headers middleware (`lib/securityHeaders.ts`)
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection
- Implemented Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for production
- Added Permissions Policy to restrict browser features

**Security Headers Added:**
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Content-Security-Policy: [comprehensive CSP]
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

### ðŸ”µ 2. Enhanced Authentication Security
**Status:** âœ… Implemented

**Enhancements:**
- Improved JWT token security with proper expiration and algorithms
- Enhanced cookie security with proper flags
- Implemented secure token generation and validation
- Added proper error handling without information disclosure

### ðŸ”µ 3. CORS Security Improvements
**Status:** âœ… Implemented

**Enhancements:**
- Implemented origin validation
- Added proper CORS headers with security considerations
- Restricted allowed origins to trusted domains
- Added proper preflight request handling

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### âœ… 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Rate limiting, CSRF protection, input validation
- Security headers, authentication, authorization

### âœ… 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Debug endpoints disabled in production
- Proper access controls on sensitive endpoints
- User-specific rate limiting

### âœ… 3. Secure by Default
- All new endpoints use comprehensive security middleware
- Default security headers applied
- Input validation enabled by default

### âœ… 4. Fail Securely
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Graceful degradation on security failures
- Secure default configurations

## Remaining Recommendations

### ðŸŸ¡ 1. Database Security
**Recommendation:** Implement database connection pooling and query parameterization
**Priority:** Medium
**Timeline:** Next sprint

### ðŸŸ¡ 2. Logging and Monitoring
**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive security logging and monitoring
**Priority:** Medium
**Timeline:** Next sprint

### ðŸŸ¡ 3. Session Management
**Recommendation:** Implement session timeout and concurrent session limits
**Priority:** Low
**Timeline:** Future enhancement

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing Checklist

- âœ… A03:2021 - Injection
- âœ… A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
- âœ… A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

## Conclusion

The security audit identified and remediated several critical vulnerabilities in the FloHub application. All high and critical security issues have been addressed, and comprehensive security enhancements have been implemented.

The application now follows security best practices and implements multiple layers of protection against common attack vectors. Regular security assessments and monitoring are recommended to maintain the security posture.

**Overall Security Posture:** âœ… Significantly Improved

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement remaining medium-priority recommendations
2. Conduct comprehensive security testing
3. Establish regular security review process
4. Monitor for new vulnerabilities
