## 🧠 **Intelligence Examples**

### **Learning in Action**
1. **Habit Pattern Recognition**: AI notices user completes "Morning Run" only on weekends
2. **Proactive Suggestion**: "You complete running 300% more on weekends. Consider weekend-only scheduling?"
3. **User Action**: Clicks "Apply Suggestion" 
4. **AI Implementation**: Automatically adjusts habit to weekend-only with custom schedule
5. **Continuous Learning**: Monitors new pattern and adjusts future recommendations

### **Natural Language Understanding**
```
User: "When did I last work on the website redesign?"
AI: "The most recent task matching your query was 'Update homepage layout', created 3 days ago. It's still pending with #design tag."

User: "Show me everything related to client meetings"
AI: "Found 8 items: 5 meeting notes, 3 tasks. Most recent was 'Client Feedback Session' yesterday with 2 action items created."

User: "How are my productivity habits?"
AI: "You have 3 successful habits (>80% consistency) and 2 struggling habits (<50%). Your 'Daily Planning' habit works best at 8 AM on weekdays."
```

### **Actionable Intelligence**
```
🟡 Medium Priority - 85% Confident
"Consider adjusting 'Daily Reading' frequency"
You've completed it 8/30 times this month (27% consistency). Consider changing to weekly to build momentum.

💡 Reasoning: Daily habits with low consistency often benefit from reduced frequency to rebuild confidence.
✨ Action: One-click frequency change from daily → weekly
```
