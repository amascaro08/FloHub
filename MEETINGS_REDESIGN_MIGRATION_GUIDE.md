# Meetings Page Redesign & Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the redesign of the meetings page to follow the consistent design language of other FlowHub pages and the separation of meeting notes from regular notes for better organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Design Language Consistency
- **Header Structure**: Now follows the same pattern as tasks, notes, and journal pages
- **Navigation Tabs**: Added tabbed interface (Recent, Series, Actions, Upcoming)
- **Modern Layout**: Card-based layout with consistent styling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Empty States**: Consistent empty state designs

### 2. Meeting Notes Separation
- **API Fix**: Modified `/api/notes` to exclude meeting notes
- **Database Schema**: Optional new `meeting_notes` table for better organization
- **Meeting Linking**: Added series detection and context building

### 3. New Features
- **Meeting Series**: Automatically groups related meetings for context
- **Action Items View**: Centralized view of all meeting actions
- **Upcoming Meetings**: Integration with calendar for scheduled meetings
- **Context Building**: Better linking between related meetings

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (Optional but Recommended)

Run the SQL script to create the new `meeting_notes` table:

```bash
# Connect to your Neon database and run:
psql "your-neon-connection-string" -f create_meeting_notes_table.sql
```

The script includes:
- New `meeting_notes` table with enhanced fields
- Indexes for performance
- Automatic updated_at trigger
- Optional data migration from existing notes table

### Step 2: Verify API Changes

The following APIs have been updated:

1. **`/api/notes`**: Now excludes meeting notes (where `eventId` IS NOT NULL OR `isAdhoc` = true)
2. **`/api/meetings`**: Continues to work with existing meeting notes
3. **New fields supported**: `meeting_series_id`, `parent_meeting_id`, `meeting_type`, etc.

### Step 3: Test the New Interface

1. **Navigation**: Test all four tabs (Recent, Series, Actions, Upcoming)
2. **Search & Filter**: Verify search functionality works across all content
3. **Mobile Experience**: Test responsive design on mobile devices
4. **Meeting Creation**: Test creating new meeting notes
5. **Series Detection**: Create multiple meetings with similar titles to test grouping

### Step 4: Data Migration (If Using New Table)

If you choose to migrate to the new `meeting_notes` table:

```sql
-- Enable the migration sections in the SQL script
-- Uncomment these lines in create_meeting_notes_table.sql:

INSERT INTO meeting_notes (
    user_email, title, content, tags, created_at, event_id, event_title, 
    is_adhoc, actions, agenda, ai_summary
)
SELECT 
    user_email, title, content, tags, created_at, event_id, event_title,
    is_adhoc, actions, agenda, ai_summary
FROM notes 
WHERE event_id IS NOT NULL OR is_adhoc = TRUE;

-- After verifying migration, clean up:
DELETE FROM notes WHERE event_id IS NOT NULL OR is_adhoc = TRUE;
```

## New Meeting Features

### Meeting Series Detection
The system automatically detects meeting series by:
- Removing date patterns from meeting titles
- Grouping meetings with similar base titles
- Providing easy navigation between related meetings

### Enhanced Context Building
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Link follow-up meetings to originals
- **Series Tracking**: Maintain context across recurring meetings
- **Action Item Tracking**: Centralized view of all action items
- **Attendee Management**: Track who was in each meeting

### Improved Action Management
- **Status Tracking**: Todo vs Done actions
- **Assignment Tracking**: Who is responsible for each action
- **Meeting Context**: Easy navigation back to source meetings
- **Progress Overview**: Visual indicators for action completion

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Consistent Experience**: Same design language across all pages
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between notes and meeting notes
- **Context Building**: Easy access to related meetings and actions
- **Mobile Optimized**: Better experience on all devices

### For Developers
- **Maintainable Code**: Consistent patterns across components
- **Scalable Architecture**: Separate table allows for meeting-specific features
- **Better Performance**: Optimized queries and indexes
- **Feature Rich**: Enhanced fields for future meeting features

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. **Revert API Changes**: Restore original `/api/notes` endpoint
2. **Revert UI**: Use git to revert meetings page changes
3. **Database Cleanup**: If using new table, migrate data back to notes table
