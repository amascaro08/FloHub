# Feedback Page Authentication Fix

## Problem Resolved ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Feedback page was redirecting users to login immediately, preventing them from accessing the form.

**Root Cause**: Overly aggressive authentication checking that redirected users before they could even attempt to submit feedback.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed Premature Authentication Redirects**

**Before**: Page would redirect to login immediately if user wasn't authenticated
```typescript
// Aggressive auth check - redirected immediately
if (authAttempted && (isError || !user)) {
  router.push('/login');
}
```

**After**: Let users access the form, handle authentication only when submitting
```typescript
// Authentication handled during submission
if (response.status === 401) {
  setSubmitMessage('Please sign in to submit feedback. Redirecting to login...');
  setTimeout(() => router.push(loginUrl), 2000);
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**

#### A. Clear User Guidance
- Show warning message for non-authenticated users
- Inform users they'll be prompted to sign in when submitting
- No forced redirects until necessary

#### B. Graceful Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Handle auth during submission, not page load
if (response.status === 401) {
  setSubmitMessage('Please sign in to submit feedback. Redirecting to login...');
  setTimeout(() => {
    const currentPath = router.asPath;
    const loginUrl = `/login?redirect=${encodeURIComponent(currentPath)}`;
    router.push(loginUrl);
  }, 2000);
}
```

### 3. **Added CORS Support**

Enhanced the GitHub issues API with proper CORS headers for cross-domain functionality:

```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://flohub.xyz',
  'https://www.flohub.xyz', 
  'https://flohub.vercel.app',
  'http://localhost:3000'
];
```

### 4. **Added Debugging Tools**

#### A. GitHub Configuration Test Endpoint
- `/api/test-github-config` - Tests if environment variables are properly set
- Accessible to authenticated users for troubleshooting
- Shows configuration status without exposing sensitive data

#### B. Debug Button in UI
- "Test GitHub Config" button for signed-in users
- Helps diagnose environment variable issues
- Shows configuration status in popup

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=your_github_username_or_org  
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your_repository_name
```

## User Flow Now

1. **Access Page**: Users can access feedback page without being signed in
2. **Fill Form**: Users can fill out the feedback form completely
3. **Submit**: When submitting:
   - If signed in ‚Üí Creates GitHub issue immediately
   - If not signed in ‚Üí Shows message and redirects to login
4. **Post-Login**: User is redirected back to feedback page to complete submission
