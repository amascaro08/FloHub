# Calendar Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Google OAuth Callback Implementation
**Problem**: The Google OAuth callback (`pages/api/auth/callback/google-additional.ts`) was incomplete with placeholder comments instead of actual implementation.

**Fix**: 
- Implemented complete OAuth flow with proper token exchange
- Added user authentication and database storage for Google tokens
- Properly create calendar sources when Google Calendar is connected
- Added error handling and logging

### 2. PowerAutomate URL Parsing Issues
**Problem**: PowerAutomate URLs were not being properly parsed and saved as calendar sources.

**Fix**:
- Updated calendar API to properly handle PowerAutomate URLs from multiple sources (calendar sources, legacy settings, query parameters)
- Fixed calendar settings component to properly trim and validate URLs
- Added proper conversion from legacy PowerAutomate URL to calendar source format

### 3. Calendar Sources Not Being Saved
**Problem**: User settings API was missing `calendarSources` field in responses and default settings.

**Fix**:
- Added `calendarSources`, `timezone`, `floCatSettings`, and `layouts` fields to user settings API
- Updated default settings to include these fields
- Fixed Google OAuth callback to properly save calendar sources

### 4. "Invalid Provider" Error
**Problem**: Calendar API was returning "Invalid provider" error when no calendar sources were found.

**Fix**:
- Added proper handling for empty calendar sources
- Return empty array instead of error when no enabled calendar sources exist
- Improved error handling and logging

### 5. API URL Format Issues
**Problem**: Calendar widgets were still using old API format with `calendarId` parameters instead of new calendar sources system.

**Fix**:
- Updated CalendarWidget to use `useCalendarSources=true` parameter
- Updated meetings page to use new calendar sources system
- AtAGlanceWidget was already properly implemented

### 6. Authentication Issues
**Problem**: Internal API calls were missing proper authentication headers.

**Fix**:
- Added Cookie headers to internal API calls in calendar API
- Ensured proper authentication forwarding between API endpoints

## Testing

To test the fixes:

   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Verify calendar source is created and events appear

2. **PowerAutomate URL**:
   - Go to Settings > Calendar

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Google Calendar**: Should properly authenticate, create calendar sources, and display events

3. **Calendar Page**: Should load without "Invalid provider" errors
4. **Dashboard Widgets**: Should display calendar events from enabled sources
5. **Settings**: Should properly save and display calendar sources

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the debug endpoint: `/api/calendar/debug`
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check database for proper calendar sources storage
5. Ensure Google OAuth credentials are valid
