# 🔍 SmartAIAssistant Debug Tools Available

**Status:** READY FOR TESTING  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Investigating "Failed to load user context" error 

## 🛠️ **New Debug Endpoints Created**

### **1. Enhanced Test Endpoint** (`/api/assistant/test`)
**What it does:** Tests all components including detailed SmartAIAssistant debugging

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/assistant/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"message": "test"}'
```

**New Features:**
- ✅ Step-by-step SmartAIAssistant testing
- ✅ Detailed error stack traces
- ✅ Context loading verification
- ✅ Query processing testing

### **2. Database Context Debug** (`/api/assistant/debug-context`)
**What it does:** Tests each database query individually to isolate the failing query

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/assistant/debug-context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ Tasks query (`tasks.user_email`)
- ✅ Notes query (`notes.user_email`)
- ✅ Habits query (`habits.userId`)
- ✅ Habit completions query (`habitCompletions.userId`)
- ✅ User settings query (`userSettings.user_email`)
- ✅ Individual error handling per query

### **3. Enhanced Error Logging**
**Added to SmartAIAssistant:**
- Detailed error messages with user context
- Stack trace logging
- Step-by-step query execution logging

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Step 1: Test Enhanced Endpoint**
Run `/api/assistant/test` again to see:
- Detailed error messages
- Stack traces
- Exact failure point

### **Step 2: Test Database Queries**
Run `/api/assistant/debug-context` to see:
- Which specific database query is failing
- Database connection status
- Query result counts
- Individual query errors

### **Step 3: Analyze Results**
Based on the results, we can:
- Identify the specific failing query
- See if it's a database schema issue
- Check if it's a permission/connection issue
- Verify field name mismatches

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**

### **If Database Query Fails:**
We'll see which specific table/query is causing the issue:
```json
{
  "queries": {
    "tasks": { "success": true, "count": 5 },
    "habits": { "success": false, "error": "column does not exist" }
  }
}
```

### **If All Queries Succeed:**
The issue is in the SmartAIAssistant logic, not database access:
```json
{
  "queries": {
    "tasks": { "success": true, "count": 5 },
    "notes": { "success": true, "count": 2 },
    "habits": { "success": true, "count": 3 }
  }
}
```

## 📊 **Possible Issues We'll Identify**

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**
   - Field names don't match between code and database
   - Table doesn't exist
   - Column types are incompatible

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Database user doesn't have SELECT permissions
   - Connection string is incorrect
   - Database is not accessible

3. **Data Type Issues**
   - Date formatting problems
   - String vs integer mismatches
   - NULL handling issues

4. **Logic Errors**
   - Incorrect WHERE clause conditions
   - Invalid JOIN operations
   - Query timeout issues

**🚀 Next Steps:**
1. Run the enhanced test endpoint first
2. If still failing, run the debug-context endpoint
3. Share both results for precise diagnosis
4. Apply targeted fixes based on specific failing query

**These tools will pinpoint exactly what's wrong with the SmartAIAssistant context loading!**
