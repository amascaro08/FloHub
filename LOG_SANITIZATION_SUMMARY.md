# Log Sanitization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive log sanitization implemented across the application to prevent exposure of personal information in browser console and server logs.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. User Settings API (`pages/api/userSettings.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged full user emails and complete user settings data including personal information
- **AFTER**: Sanitized all user email references and replaced user data with `[SANITIZED - contains user data]`
- **Impact**: Prevents exposure of user preferences, custom activities, and personal settings

### 2. OAuth and Authentication Logs
#### Google OAuth Callback (`pages/api/auth/callback/google-additional.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged actual user emails, provider account IDs, and partial tokens
- **AFTER**: Replaced with `[SANITIZED]` while preserving debugging information about token existence
- **Impact**: Protects OAuth tokens and user identity information

#### Google Multi-Auth Library (`lib/googleMultiAuth.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged partial OAuth client secrets and authorization codes
- **AFTER**: Replaced sensitive values with `[PRESENT]` indicators and `[SANITIZED]` placeholders
- **Impact**: Prevents OAuth credential exposure

### 3. Password Reset API (`pages/api/auth/reset-password.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails and full password reset URLs
- **AFTER**: Removed email addresses from logs and sanitized reset URL references
- **Impact**: Protects user email addresses and prevents reset URL exposure

### 4. Calendar Integration APIs
#### Calendar List API (`pages/api/calendar/list.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails for every calendar request
- **AFTER**: Sanitized user email references with `[SANITIZED]`

#### Calendar Event API (`pages/api/calendar/event.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails and partial access tokens
- **AFTER**: Sanitized user emails and token references

#### Calendar Refresh Sources (`pages/api/calendar/refresh-sources.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails in multiple locations during calendar source refresh
- **AFTER**: Replaced all user email references with `[SANITIZED]`

### 5. User Management and Admin APIs
#### Admin Delete User Accounts (`pages/api/admin/delete-user-accounts.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged requesting admin email and target user email
- **AFTER**: Sanitized both admin and target user emails

#### Admin Delete User (`pages/api/admin/delete-user.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged admin email and target user email in deletion operations
- **AFTER**: Replaced with `[SANITIZED]` placeholders

#### Admin Communication (`pages/api/admin/communicate.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged target user emails in error messages
- **AFTER**: Sanitized email references in error logs

#### User Account Deletion (`pages/api/user/delete-account.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails and user IDs during account deletion
- **AFTER**: Sanitized user emails and IDs with `[SANITIZED]` placeholders

### 6. Authentication and Cache Management (`lib/auth.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails during data cleanup operations
- **AFTER**: Replaced user email references with `[SANITIZED]` in all cleanup logs

### 7. Client-Side React Components
#### Layout Component (`components/ui/Layout.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails when loading sidebar preferences
- **AFTER**: Sanitized user email reference

#### Journal Settings (`components/journal/JournalSettings.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged complete user settings data and custom activities
- **AFTER**: Replaced with sanitized placeholders indicating data presence without exposure

#### Activity Tracker (`components/journal/ActivityTracker.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged full user settings and custom activities data
- **AFTER**: Sanitized user data references

#### Meeting Note Detail (`components/meetings/MeetingNoteDetail.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged complete note titles and content during updates
- **AFTER**: Sanitized note content while preserving metadata

### 8. Power Automate Integration (`lib/powerAutomateSync.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails in sync start, completion, and error messages
- **AFTER**: Replaced user email references with `[SANITIZED]`

### 9. AI Assistant (`lib/aiAssistant.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails when loading context and in error messages
- **AFTER**: Sanitized user email references

### 10. Debug APIs (`pages/api/userSettingsDebug.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Logged user emails in error messages
- **AFTER**: Removed user email from error logs

## New Security Infrastructure

### Sanitized Logger Utility (`lib/sanitizedLogger.ts`)
Created a comprehensive logging utility that:

- **Automatically detects and sanitizes** multiple types of sensitive data:
  - Email addresses
  - OAuth tokens and API keys
  - Passwords
  - JWTs
  - Credit card numbers
  - Phone numbers
  - SSNs
  - User IDs

- **Provides safe logging methods**:
  - `SanitizedLogger.log()`, `error()`, `warn()`, `info()`, `debug()`
  - Utility functions for sanitizing specific data types
  - Methods for sanitizing user objects and settings

- **Pattern-based detection** using regex patterns for various sensitive data types
- **Object-aware sanitization** that checks object keys for sensitive field names

## Security Benefits

1. **Zero Personal Information Exposure**: All logs now show operational information without exposing actual user data
2. **Maintained Debugging Capability**: Logs still indicate presence/absence of data and operational status
3. **Future Protection**: New sanitized logger utility prevents accidental exposure in future development
4. **Compliance Ready**: Log sanitization supports privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
5. **Malicious Actor Protection**: Even if logs are compromised, no personal information is accessible

## Debugging Information Preserved

While sanitizing personal data, the following debugging information is retained:

- **Token/Data Presence**: Logs indicate whether tokens, emails, or data exist
- **Array Lengths**: Shows count of items without revealing content
- **Operation Status**: Success/failure status of operations
- **Data Types**: Type information for debugging data structure issues
- **Error Details**: Error messages without sensitive data
- **API Response Status**: HTTP status codes and API response metadata

## Implementation Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - sanitization only occurs during logging
- **Development Mode**: Some sanitized logs include helpful development notes
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uses standardized `[SANITIZED]` placeholders throughout

## Future Recommendations

1. **Use SanitizedLogger**: Import and use the new sanitized logger for all new logging
2. **Code Reviews**: Include log sanitization checks in code review processes
3. **Testing**: Verify logs don't expose sensitive data in testing environments
4. **Monitoring**: Regular audits of log files to ensure continued compliance

## Testing Verification

After implementation, verify that:
1. ✅ No user emails appear in browser console logs
2. ✅ No OAuth tokens or API keys are logged
3. ✅ No user-generated content appears in logs
4. ✅ Application functionality remains unchanged
5. ✅ Error handling and debugging remain effective

This comprehensive sanitization ensures that your application's logs are secure and compliant with privacy best practices while maintaining essential debugging capabilities.
