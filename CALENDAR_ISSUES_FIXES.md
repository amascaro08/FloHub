# Calendar Issues Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Agenda View Improvement
**Problem**: The agenda view was showing events in a simple list format instead of mapping events across hourly time slots for the current day.

**Solution**: 
- Redesigned the agenda view to show a 24-hour breakdown with hourly time slots
- Added `getEventsForHour()` function to filter events by specific hours using `isSameHour()` from date-fns
- Created visual distinctions for:
  - Current hour (highlighted with primary colors)
  - Past hours (dimmed opacity)
  - Future hours (normal styling)
- Events are now mapped to their specific hour slots with proper time display
- Added event count indicators for each hour
- Improved responsive design for better mobile experience

### 2. Day View Refresh Loop Fix
**Problem**: Day view was causing continuous refreshes that deleted calendar sources, requiring users to refresh settings.

**Solution**:
- Stabilized the `useCalendarEvents` hook dependencies to prevent infinite re-render loops
- Separated `loadEventsStable` function with explicit date parameters to avoid dependency cycles
- Increased debounce timeouts to prevent rapid successive calls:
  - Calendar sources change: 3 seconds
  - Date range changes: 1 second
- Used `getTime()` for date dependencies to create stable references
- Removed unstable function dependencies from useEffect hooks
- Added proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-computations

### 3. OAuth Domain Redirect Issue
**Problem**: Google Calendar OAuth always redirected to the domain specified in `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable, even when the request came from a different domain (e.g., vercel.app vs .xyz domain).

**Solution**:
- Modified `getGoogleOAuthUrl()` in `lib/googleMultiAuth.ts` to accept optional `requestOrigin` parameter
- Updated `getGoogleTokens()` to use dynamic redirect URI matching the request origin
- Enhanced `pages/api/calendar/connect.ts` to detect request origin from headers:
  - Uses `x-forwarded-proto` and `x-forwarded-host` for proxy detection
  - Falls back to `host` header if forwarded headers not available
  - Constructs proper protocol://host format
- Updated OAuth callback (`pages/api/auth/callback/google-additional.ts`) to:
  - Detect the same request origin
  - Pass it to `getGoogleTokens()` for consistent redirect URI
  - Use detected origin for internal API calls
- Both domains (www.flohub.xyz and flohub.vercel.app) now work seamlessly

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/pages/calendar/index.tsx` - Agenda view redesign and day view stabilization
2. `/lib/googleMultiAuth.ts` - Dynamic OAuth domain detection
3. `/pages/api/calendar/connect.ts` - Request origin detection
4. `/pages/api/auth/callback/google-additional.ts` - Callback origin handling
5. `/hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts` - Refresh loop prevention

### Key Improvements:
- **Performance**: Reduced API calls and prevented refresh loops
- **User Experience**: Better agenda view with hourly breakdown
- **Multi-domain Support**: Seamless OAuth across different domains
- **Stability**: More reliable calendar source management

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Test agenda view on current day vs other days
2. Verify day view doesn't cause refresh loops
3. Test Google Calendar OAuth from both domains
4. Confirm calendar sources persist after OAuth completion
5. Check mobile responsiveness of agenda view

## Environment Variables Required:
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (used as fallback when request origin detection fails)

Both domains should be configured in Google Cloud Console OAuth settings for proper functionality.
