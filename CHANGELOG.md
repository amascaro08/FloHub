# Changelog - Session of 2025-07-18

This document outlines the significant changes, refactoring, and bug fixes implemented during this development session. The primary goal was to resolve an issue with user settings not being saved, which led to a comprehensive overhaul of the application's database layer and the resolution of numerous related and unrelated issues.

## Initial Bug: User Settings Not Saving

*   **Problem:** The `power_automate_url` and other user settings were not being saved, resulting in a `500 Internal Server Error` on the `/api/userSettings/update` endpoint.
*   **Resolution:** The initial investigation pointed to issues with the raw SQL queries being used. This led to the decision to refactor the entire database layer to use a more robust and type-safe solution.

## Comprehensive Database Refactor

To address the root cause of the issues and improve the overall stability and maintainability of the application, the following changes were made:

1.  **Drizzle ORM Integration:** All raw SQL queries have been replaced with Drizzle ORM, a modern, type-safe TypeScript ORM. This eliminates the risk of SQL injection, provides better type safety, and simplifies database interactions.

2.  **Neon Serverless Driver:** The standard `pg` driver has been replaced with the `@neondatabase/serverless` driver, which is specifically optimized for serverless environments like Vercel. This resolves the underlying database connection issues that were causing the persistent 500 errors.

3.  **Centralized Database Client:** A single, centralized Drizzle client has been implemented in `lib/drizzle.ts`, and all database access throughout the application has been refactored to use this client. This eliminates redundant connection pools and ensures all database operations are handled by the optimized serverless driver.

4.  **Schema Synchronization:** The Drizzle schema in `db/schema.ts` has been updated to accurately reflect the structure of the Neon database. This was a critical step in resolving the login and other issues, as the local schema was out of sync with the remote database.

## API Endpoint Refactoring

All API endpoints have been refactored to use the new, centralized Drizzle client. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   `/api/userSettings/update`
*   `/api/userSettings`
*   `/api/userSettingsDebug`
*   `/api/userSettings/layouts`
*   `/api/auth/login`
*   `/api/auth/register`
*   `/api/auth/session`
*   `/api/calendar/event`
*   `/api/calendar/events`
*   `/api/meetings/create`
*   `/api/meetings/delete`
*   `/api/meetings/export-pdf`
*   `/api/meetings/index`
*   `/api/meetings/update`
*   `/api/notes/create`
*   `/api/notes/delete`
*   `/api/notes/export-pdf`
*   `/api/notes/index`
*   `/api/notes/update`
*   `/api/notifications/send`
*   `/api/notifications/subscribe`
*   `/api/notifications/test`
*   `/api/notifications/unsubscribe`
*   `/api/tasks`
*   `/api/searchByTag`
*   `/api/admin/analytics`
*   `/api/analytics/performance`
*   `/api/analytics/track`
*   `/api/assistant`
*   `/api/assistant/conversations`
*   `/api/journal/activities`
*   `/api/journal/activities/batch`
*   `/api/journal/entries/batch`
*   `/api/journal/entry`
*   `/api/journal/mood`
*   `/api/journal/moods/batch`
*   `/api/journal/sleep`

## Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

*   **Console Errors on Hub:** Resolved a critical issue causing console errors on the Hub due to the database client being imported into client-side components. This was fixed by refactoring the authentication and context logic to separate database queries from token verification, preventing server-side code from being bundled with the client.
*   **Database Query Failures:** Fixed a series of "Failed query" errors that were occurring in various API routes. These errors were caused by incorrect database queries and have been resolved by updating the queries to match the current database schema.
*   **Login Regression:** A critical regression that was preventing users from logging in has been resolved. The issue was caused by a schema mismatch and has been fixed by updating the Drizzle schema.
*   **Type Safety:** Numerous type errors throughout the application have been resolved, resulting in a more stable and maintainable codebase.
*   **Dependency Management:** The `bcryptjs` package and its types have been reinstalled to ensure they are correctly installed and compatible with the rest of the application.
*   **Code Cleanup:** Redundant database connection files and other unused code have been removed.
