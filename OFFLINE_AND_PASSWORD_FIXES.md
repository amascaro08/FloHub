# Offline Issue and Password Visibility Fixes

## Summary

Fixed two critical issues:
1. **Offline Detection Problem**: App was incorrectly showing offline page even when users were online
2. **Password Visibility**: Added password visibility toggle for all password input fields

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Offline Detection Problem

**Problem**: Service worker was too aggressive in serving the offline.html page when network requests failed, even for temporary network hiccups or slow responses.

**Root Cause**: The service worker's fetch event handler was catching all network errors and immediately serving the offline page for navigation requests, without properly checking if the user was actually offline.

**Solution**: Enhanced the service worker with:
- Better offline detection using `navigator.onLine`
- Request timeout handling (10 seconds)
- More intelligent error checking
- API request exclusions
- Only serves offline page for genuine offline conditions

**Files Modified**:
- `public/sw.js` - Updated cache version to `flohub-v2` and improved offline logic
- `pages/_app.tsx` - Added PWAStatus component to show online/offline status

### 2. Password Visibility Toggle

**Problem**: Users couldn't see their password while typing, making it difficult to verify correct input.

**Solution**: Created a reusable PasswordInput component with eye icon toggle functionality.

**Features**:
- Toggle password visibility with eye/eye-off icons
- Proper accessibility labels
- Consistent styling with existing form inputs
- Supports all standard input props (placeholder, required, etc.)

**Files Created**:
- `components/ui/PasswordInput.tsx` - New reusable password input component

**Files Modified**:
- `components/ui/LoginForm.tsx` - Uses new PasswordInput component
- `components/ui/RegisterForm.tsx` - Uses new PasswordInput component  
- `pages/reset-password.tsx` - Uses new PasswordInput component for both password fields

## Technical Details

### Service Worker Improvements

```javascript
// Helper function to check if user is truly offline
function isReallyOffline() {
  return !navigator.onLine;
}

// Helper function to check if request should show offline page
function shouldShowOfflinePage(request, error) {
  // Only show offline page for navigation requests
  if (request.mode !== 'navigate') {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Don't show offline page for API requests
  if (request.url.includes('/api/')) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Only show offline page if user is actually offline
  // or if it's a genuine network error (not just a slow response)
  if (isReallyOffline()) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Check if it's a genuine network error
  if (error && (error.name === 'TypeError' || error.message === 'Failed to fetch')) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### Password Input Component

```typescript
interface PasswordInputProps {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  required?: boolean;
  className?: string;
  label?: string;
  autoComplete?: string;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users no longer see false offline messages
2. **Better Password UX**: Users can verify their password input
3. **Network Resilience**: App handles temporary network issues gracefully
4. **Visual Feedback**: PWAStatus component shows actual connection state
5. **Accessibility**: Password visibility toggle includes proper ARIA labels

## Testing

- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ TypeScript validation passes
- ✅ All components properly typed
- ✅ Service worker cache version updated to force refresh

## Deployment

The fixes are ready for deployment. The updated service worker (`flohub-v2`) will automatically replace the old version and resolve the offline detection issues.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding retry logic for failed network requests
2. Implement network quality detection
3. Add user preferences for offline behavior
4. Consider caching strategy improvements
